## Project Shakti: Empowering Women's Safety in Remote Areas

I'm excited to share my latest project - a comprehensive women's safety app designed specifically for remote and rural areas where internet connectivity is limited.

## The Problem

Women in remote areas face unique safety challenges with limited access to immediate help and weak digital infrastructure.

## The Solution - Project Shakti

- **Community Support System** - Real-time chat connecting women for mutual support and safety tips
- **Smart Emergency Response** - Quick access to Police (100), Women Helpline (1091), and Ambulance (108)
- **Location Sharing** - Share real-time GPS coordinates with trusted contacts instantly
- **Safety Resources** - Comprehensive safety tips and emergency helplines

## Tech Stack

React Native | Expo | AsyncStorage | SMS API | Location Services | Linear Gradients

## Key Features
