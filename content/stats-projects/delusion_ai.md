## Project Overview

I was a core contributor to Delusion, a real-time, cross-media detection platform designed to protect identity, trust, and truth in the digital age. We engineered Delusion as the ultimate defense against the flood of AI-generated scams, deepfakes, and impersonations spreading rapidly across the web and various applications.
