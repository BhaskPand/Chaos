My name is Anil Battalahalli (ಅನಿಲ ಬಟ್ಟಲಹಳ್ಳಿ) <text style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #808080;"><small>(he/they)</small></text>. I graduated from the [University of Michigan – Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) with an Applied Statistics Master’s. At the graduate school, I worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant (GSRA) for the Data Science for Dynamic Intervention Decision-making Center (d3c), a research center at the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan. At d3c I worked on developing statistical computational tools for clustered Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART).

Following my graduation, I worked as a Lead Statistical Associate at [Westat](https://www.westat.com) from 2022 till 2025 working on problems in survey statistics. I worked on incorporating machine learning techniques to solve problems in survey methods and presented my work at the the [American Association for Public Opinion Research Conference (AAPOR)](https://aapor.org) and the [Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM)](https://www.fcsm.gov)

I also like building electronic circuits, robots, and embedded systems projects to automate absolutely useless things. I have started several startups right from my high school times in robotics, industrial automation, IoT, etc. None of them really took off, but you might often catch me throwing the “it was a learning opportunity and I don’t regret it” mantra to cope.

I’m proficient in Python and R, and I’m trying to learn Julia. I also do machine learning, NLP, deep learning, <** insert other tech buzzwords **>

### Some Hobbies

Apart from the nerd stuff, I love producing electronic music. I predominantly use FL Studio 20 (DAW) and Serum (Sound Design)

**I produced the following slap house track for [Blink](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19874970/), a Kannada movie**
