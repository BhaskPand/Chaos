<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #808080;"><small>I look somewhat like this in low light</small></p>

I'm currently immersing myself in Information Science Engineering at APSCE, where learning feels like a grand adventure. Beyond the classroom, I proudly lead as the captain of our college cricket team—a role that's gifted me unforgettable moments on university fields and the thrill of teamwork at its best.

My passion lies in crafting software solutions that truly make a difference. I'm endlessly curious about digital marketing and the world of defense technologies, always seeking new ways to combine creativity with impact.

When I'm not coding or on the cricket pitch, you'll find me exploring the ups and downs of the financial markets—trading both challenges and opportunities. Music is my escape and inspiration; it keeps my creativity flowing and my spirit grounded.

Above all, I believe in chasing dreams with heart, learning from every experience, and spreading positivity along the way. Let's build, explore, and make a difference—together!
